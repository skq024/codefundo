# Scraper - code.fun.do 2018-19 
This is team *Invincibles'* idea for code.fun.do 2018-19
Developing a social scraper, which scrapes tweets from twitter, and posts from facebook and runs them through a software which searches for certain keywords related to natural disasters. We would also monitor the density of emergency calls in a certain neighbourhood and then alarm the people if there is a high density of emergency calls in a certain neighbourhood. The social media uploads would be screened for a certain neighbourhood and would be sorted using a classifier based on retweets, reacts and keywords, and an app would flash the tweets and posts in the app as a news feed in real-time. This would ensure that the news reaches the right people faster and before the agencies can cover it. Also, it gives real-time and first hand data with minimal latency.
